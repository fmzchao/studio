# ShipSec Studio
**Open-Source Security Workflow Orchestration Platform.**

> ShipSec is currently in active development. We are optimizing the platform for stable production use and high-performance security operations.

ShipSec Studio provides a visual DSL and runtime for building, executing, and monitoring automated security workflows. It decouples security logic from infrastructure management, providing a durable and isolated environment for running security tooling at scale.

### 🏗️ Core Pillars

*   **Durable, resumable workflows** powered by Temporal.io for stateful execution across failures.
*   **Isolated security runtimes** using ephemeral containers with per-run volume management.
*   **Unified telemetry streams** delivering terminal output, events, and logs via a low-latency SSE pipeline.
*   **Visual no-code builder** that compiles complex security graphs into an executable DSL.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. ShipSec Cloud (Preview)
The fastest way to test ShipSec Studio without managing infrastructure.
- **Try it out:** [studio.shipsec.ai](https://studio.shipsec.ai)
- **Note:** ShipSec Studio is under active development. The cloud environment is a technical preview for evaluation and sandbox testing.

### 2. Self-Host (Docker)
For teams requiring data residency and air-gapped security orchestrations. This setup runs the full stack (Frontend, Backend, Worker, and Infrastructure).

**Prerequisites:** Docker, `just` command runner.

```bash
# Clone and start the latest stable release
git clone https://github.com/ShipSecAI/studio.git
cd studio
just prod start-latest
```
Access the studio at `http://localhost:8090`.

## 🛠️ Capabilities

### Integrated Tooling
Native support for industry-standard security tools including:
- **Discovery**: `Subfinder`, `DNSX`, `Naabu`, `HTTPx`
- **Vulnerability**: `Nuclei`, `TruffleHog`
- **Utility**: `JSON Transform`, `Logic Scripts`, `HTTP Requests`

### Advanced Orchestration
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause workflows for approvals, form inputs, or manual validation before continuing.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Leverage LLM nodes and MCP providers for intelligent results interpretation.
- **Native Scheduling**: Integrated CRON support for recurring security posture and compliance monitoring.
- **API First**: Trigger and monitor any workflow execution via a comprehensive REST API.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

ShipSec Studio is designed for enterprise-grade durability and horizontal scalability.

- **Management Plane (Backend)**: NestJS service handling DSL compilation, secret management (AES-256-GCM), and identity.
- **Orchestration Plane (Temporal)**: Manages workflow state, concurrency, and persistent wait states.
- **Execution Plane (Worker)**: Stateless agents that pull tasks from Temporal and execute tool-bound activities in isolated runtimes.
- **Monitoring (SSE/Loki)**: Real-time telemetry pipeline for deterministic execution visibility.
