# ShipSec Studio

The no-code security automation studio for security teams. Design reliable and reusable security workflows.

ShipSec Studio is a security workflow orchestration platform that combines the power of visual programming with enterprise-grade reliability. Unlike traditional automation tools that require complex scripting, ShipSec Studio lets you build security workflows through an intuitive canvas while maintaining the robustness your team needs.

## Why ShipSec Studio?

🎨 **Visual Workflow Builder** : Design security automations with drag-and-drop, no coding required

⚡ **Real-Time Execution** : Watch workflows run live with streaming logs and progress indicators

🧩 **Pre-Built Security Components** : Subfinder, DNSX, HTTPx, Nuclei, and more ready to use

🔒 **Enterprise Reliability** : Built on Temporal for durable, resumable workflow executions

🛡️ **Secure by Default** : Encrypted secrets, role-based access, and audit trails

💻 **Run Anywhere** : Cloud hosted or self-hosted on your own infrastructure

📅 **Scheduled Workflows** : Schedule your scans to run at specific times or intervals

🔗 **Codify Your Workflows** : Trigger workflows via a simple POST request, through cURL, python etc.

## Quick Start

Get started with ShipSec Studio in minutes:

### Option 1: Use the Hosted Platform

1. **Sign up** at [studio.shipsec.ai](https://studio.shipsec.ai)
2. **Create your first workflow** using the visual builder
3. **Run a scan** with pre-built components like Subfinder, Nuclei, or HTTPx
4. **View results** in real-time as the workflow executes

### Option 2: Self-Host with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run ShipSec Studio on your own infrastructure:

#### Prerequisites

- **[docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - For running the application and security components
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for simplified workflows
- **curl** and **jq** - For fetching release information

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShipSecAI/studio.git
cd studio

# Download the latest release and start
just prod start-latest

# Visit http://localhost:8090 to access ShipSec Studio
```

This command automatically:
- Fetches the latest release version from GitHub
- Pulls pre-built Docker images from GHCR
- Starts the full stack (frontend, backend, worker, and infrastructure)

#### Other Commands

```bash
just prod stop      # Stop the environment
just prod logs      # View logs
just prod status    # Check status
just prod clean     # Remove all data
```

### Option 3: Development Setup

For contributors who want to modify the source code:

#### Prerequisites

- **[bun.sh](https://bun.sh)** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **[docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - For running security components in isolated containers
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** - Command runner for simplified development workflows

#### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShipSecAI/studio.git
cd studio

# Initialize (installs dependencies and creates environment files)
just init

# Start development environment with hot-reload
just dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173 to access ShipSec Studio
```

### Your First Workflow

1. **Open the Workflow Builder** from the dashboard
2. **Add a Manual Trigger node** for manual execution
3. **Add a Subfinder node** for subdomain discovery
4. **Run the workflow** and watch real-time execution

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've just run your first security workflow in ShipSec Studio.
