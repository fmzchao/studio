# ShipSec Studio – AI Agent Roadmap

This roadmap tracks how we evolve the `core.ai.agent` component from a model-only assistant into a fully instrumented, tool-using operator inside ShipSec Studio. Phase 1 landed the Agent Trace tab, persisted reasoning/tool data on run completion, and delivered the React cards that surfaced Thought/Action/Observation history—now we are pivoting entirely to the official Vercel AI SDK transport so the UI, backend, and worker all speak the same protocol.

## Progress Overview

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | ✅ Complete | Legacy Agent Trace UI on stored outputs |
| Phase 2 | ⚪ Planned | AI SDK stream transport + storage ledger |
| Phase 3 | ⚪ Planned | Full AI SDK UI adoption & legacy removal |

## Phase 2 – AI SDK Stream Transport

**Goal:** Replace the bespoke `agent_event` bus with the official AI SDK UI message stream across worker, backend, and frontend while preserving historical storage.

> **Update — 2025‑11‑30:** Worker now emits AI SDK–compatible agent trace parts (message start, reasoning deltas, tool IO, finish) and ships them to a dedicated Kafka topic (`telemetry.agent-trace`). Backend ingest writes those parts into the new `agent_trace_events` ledger table, so we have a clean store keyed by `agentRunId`. The Agent component exposes that run ID for downstream consumers.

### Worker
- [x] Wrap `core.ai.agent` execution in the AI SDK streaming helpers (`streamText`/`createStreamableUI`) so reasoning steps, tool IO, and final responses are emitted as UI message parts.
- [x] Persist every emitted part (type, payload, timestamp, nodeRef, sequence) through a dedicated Kafka publisher so `agent_trace_events` becomes the canonical ledger for live + replay streams.
- [ ] Remove bespoke `agent_event` enums once the AI SDK part emitter is stable.

### Backend
- [ ] Add `POST /api/v1/agents/:runId/chat` that proxies the worker result and returns `result.toUIMessageStreamResponse()` for live runs.
- [ ] Add `GET /api/v1/agents/:runId/replay` and `GET /api/v1/agents/:runId/parts` that read from the new repository and stream/return the stored UI message parts in order (with cursor + timestamp metadata).
- [ ] Deprecate and then remove `/api/v1/agents/:runId/stream` once consumers switch to the new endpoints.

### Frontend
- [ ] Replace `useAgentStream` + custom reducers with `useChat` (or other AI SDK UI primitives) pointed at the new `/chat` endpoint, using `initialMessages` from `/parts` for quick hydration.
- [ ] Update the Agent Trace tab inside `ExecutionInspector` to render AI SDK components (tool cards, reasoning blocks) instead of bespoke cards.
- [ ] Ensure replay/seeker controls reset the hook and re-stream stored parts when the user scrubs.

**Success criteria**
- [ ] Live runs stream through the AI SDK protocol end-to-end and render via official components.
- [ ] Historical runs replay by streaming the stored parts and appear identical to the live experience.
- [ ] No code references `agent_event`, `useAgentStream`, or custom SSE parsers.

## Phase 3 – AI SDK UI Adoption & Legacy Retirement

**Goal:** Fully align the Studio UX with AI SDK’s UI toolkit and delete the legacy transport/UI surface.

### Deletions & Refactors
- [ ] Delete `useAgentStream`, `AgentStreamEvent` types, and any bespoke SSE helpers (`frontend/src/hooks/useAgentStream.ts`, `frontend/src/utils/sse-client.ts`).
- [ ] Remove backend polling loops/heartbeat logic tied to the legacy `/stream` endpoint.
- [ ] Strip `agentEvent` handling from TraceService consumers; only AI SDK part types remain.

### Frontend Adoption
- [ ] Swap bespoke Agent Trace cards with the AI SDK conversation components so future upgrades (tool drawers, reasoning chips) are inherited automatically.
- [ ] Hook ExecutionInspector’s replay controls into the `/replay` endpoint to rebuild state when the user scrubs or jumps to a node.
- [ ] Update docs/Runbooks to reference the new endpoints and controls.

**Success criteria**
- [ ] `git grep` shows no references to the legacy stream plumbing.
- [ ] Designers can drop in AI SDK UI blocks anywhere in Studio without adapter shims.
- [ ] Replay, seek, and historical audit features operate entirely on the stored AI SDK parts.

## Long-Tail Enhancements

- [ ] **Agent analytics:** PostHog metrics for tool latency, success rate, and per-step errors.
- [ ] **Replay controls:** Jump to a specific agent step from the timeline scrubber.
- [ ] **Audit trails:** Persist full agent transcripts (thoughts + tool IO) for compliance with redaction options.
- [ ] **Safety harness:** Add policy checks (allowed tool list, token budgets) before each tool call.
