- [x] **Step 3:** Add Temporal SDK dependencies to the backend and create `TemporalModule`/`TemporalService` that manages connections, namespaces, and workflow starts.
- [x] **Step 4:** Update `WorkflowsService` to start workflows through Temporal (generate run IDs, call client) and expose status/result/cancel helpers.
- [x] **Step 5:** Commit `feat: add temporal infrastructure & client`. ➜ **Phase complete**

---
## Phase 5 – Temporal Worker Execution ✅

**Goal:** Move component execution into Temporal workers with dedicated task queues and activities.

- [x] **Step 1:** Implement worker entrypoints (e.g., `src/temporal/workers/dev.worker.ts`) that register workflows/activities and initialise the component registry.
- [x] **Step 2:** Port the existing inline runner into Temporal activities (invoke registry components, capture outputs/artifacts, emit trace events).
- [x] **Step 3:** Ensure namespace/queue naming is configurable (default to `shipsec-dev` namespace, `shipsec-default` task queue).
- [x] **Step 4:** Provide scripts (package.json targets) to run API + worker separately and update documentation.
- [x] **Step 5:** Switch worker runtime from Bun to Node.js+tsx (Bun incompatible with Temporal SDK).
- [x] **Step 6:** Commit `feat: add temporal worker execution`. ➜ **Phase complete**

- [x] **Step 4:** Update file loader component from mock to real MinIO-backed implementation.
- [x] **Step 5:** Implement service container for dependency injection in Temporal workers.
- [x] **Step 6:** Add Component Registry API (`GET /components`, `GET /components/:id`) with OpenAPI docs.
- [x] **Step 7:** End-to-end test file upload → workflow execution → MinIO fetch → result.
- [x] **Step 8:** Commit `feat: implement real file storage with MinIO` and `feat: add component registry API`. ➜ **Phase complete**

---
## Phase 5.9 – Component SDK Package Separation ✅

**Goal:** Extract component SDK into separate worker package with clean interfaces, eliminating backend coupling.

**Architectural Refactoring:**
This phase introduced a major separation of concerns using the **Adapter Pattern** for dependency injection:

1. **packages/component-sdk/** - Pure SDK with zero backend dependencies:
   - Service interfaces (`IFileStorageService`, `ISecretsService`, `IArtifactService`, `ITraceService`)
   - Component types (`ComponentDefinition`, `ExecutionContext`, `RunnerConfig`)
   - Component registry singleton
   - Execution context factory
   - Component runner logic (inline/docker/remote)

2. **worker/** - Temporal worker with execution layer:
   - Component implementations (file-loader, trigger-manual, webhook, subfinder)
   - Service adapters implementing SDK interfaces (FileStorageAdapter ↔ MinIO+PostgreSQL)
   - Temporal worker, workflows, and activities
   - Dependency injection via adapters at runtime

3. **backend/** - API layer (no execution logic):
   - Imports component-sdk for validation
   - Imports worker for component listing
   - Temporal client (starts workflows, queries status)
   - No component implementations or execution logic

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation: Backend validates, worker executes
- ✅ Interface-based DI: Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- ✅ Portability: Components can be tested with mock services
- ✅ Swappable adapters: MinIO → S3, PostgreSQL → MongoDB without changing components
- ✅ Single source of truth: One component registry, no duplicates

**Commits:**
- [x] `refactor: extract component SDK to separate packages` - Major architectural refactor
- [x] `test: add comprehensive unit tests` - SDK and component unit tests

**Steps Completed:**
- [x] **Step 1:** Create `worker/` package with its own `package.json` and TypeScript config.
- [x] **Step 2:** Define SDK interfaces (`IFileStorageService`, `ISecretsService`, etc.) in `packages/component-sdk/src/interfaces.ts`.
- [x] **Step 3:** Move component registry, types, context, and runner to `packages/component-sdk/src/`.
- [x] **Step 4:** Move all component implementations to `worker/src/components/` (core, security categories).
- [x] **Step 5:** Create service adapters in `worker/src/adapters/` that implement SDK interfaces using backend services.
- [x] **Step 6:** Move Temporal worker code to `worker/src/temporal/workers/` and update to use adapters.
- [x] **Step 7:** Update root `package.json` to use bun workspaces for monorepo structure.
- [x] **Step 8:** Update backend to remove component code and adjust imports where needed.
- [x] **Step 9:** Fix all typecheck errors and remove duplicate code.
- [x] **Step 10:** Audit for remnants and clean up leftover files.
- [x] **Step 11:** Update `backend/tsconfig.json` to use `bundler` moduleResolution.
- [x] **Step 12:** Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` documentation. ➜ **Phase complete**

---
## Phase 6.7 – Workflow Save Fix ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Fix workflow save functionality that was showing false Zod validation errors.

**Root Cause:**
- Workflows WERE being saved correctly in the database
- Error was a frontend display issue caused by inconsistent API response format
- Backend's `create()` and `update()` methods returned raw records (nodes/edges nested in `graph`)
- But `findById()` and `findAll()` returned flattened records (nodes/edges at root level)
- Frontend Zod schema expected flattened format, causing validation to fail on create response

**Solution:**
- Modified `workflows.service.ts` to call `flattenWorkflowGraph()` in both `create()` and `update()` methods
- Ensured consistent API response format across all workflow endpoints
- Removed debug logging from frontend serializers and API client

**Investigation Steps:**
- [x] Add debug logging to `serializeWorkflowForCreate`
- [x] Add debug logging to `api.workflows.create`
- [x] Identify where `nodes` and `edges` become `undefined` - Found in response parsing
- [x] Fix the data flow issue - Added flattening to create/update responses
- [x] Verify save operation works end-to-end - Confirmed with curl testing
- [x] Remove debug logging
- [x] Test backend API returns correct structure

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Save operations now work correctly without false errors

**Commit**: `fix: flatten workflow response in create/update endpoints` (e23acc8)
