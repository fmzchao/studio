# ShipSec Studio – Auth & Org Integration Plan

Purpose: align ShipSec Studio with the platform’s identity, organization, and role model while keeping the Studio package open-source friendly. The plan assumes two roles (`ADMIN`, `MEMBER`). Clerk issues end-user tokens, and Studio consults the platform control plane via a scoped service-account channel for authoritative user/org context.

## Phase 0 – Baseline Analysis & Scaffolding

**Goal:** Capture current auth gaps, confirm schema touch points, and prepare migration scaffolding.

- [x] Inventory backend routes requiring protection; note existing repositories that need `organizationId` filtering.  
  _Routes:_ `/workflows/*`, `/secrets/*`, `/files/*`, `/components`, `/testing/webhook` (dev), `/docs`, `/health` (public).  
  _Repositories needing org scoping:_ `WorkflowRepository`, `WorkflowRunRepository`, `WorkflowVersionRepository`, `TraceRepository`, `FilesRepository`, `SecretsRepository`, `LogStreamRepository`.
- [x] Map Temporal worker touch points needing org context propagation.  
  _Worker hotspots:_ `worker/src/temporal/workflow-runner.ts` (add org-aware `ExecuteWorkflowOptions` + trace/log context), `worker/src/temporal/workflow-scheduler.ts` (propagate metadata), `worker/src/temporal/workers/*` (task queue init payload), `worker/src/temporal/activities` (set run metadata), adapters for persistence (`worker/src/adapters/trace.adapter.ts`, `worker/src/adapters/loki-log.adapter.ts`, `worker/src/adapters/file-storage.adapter.ts`, `worker/src/adapters/secrets.adapter.ts`).
- [x] Draft DB migration stubs for `organization_id` columns (workflows, runs, secrets, files).  
  _Migration:_ `backend/drizzle/0008_add-org-scoping.sql` introduces nullable `organization_id` columns plus indexes; schema definitions updated accordingly.
- [x] Decide on configuration surface (`AUTH_PROVIDER`, provider options) and place holder config schema.  
  _Config:_ `backend/src/config/auth.config.ts` registered via `ConfigModule`, with supporting env examples in `backend/.env.example` (Clerk requires `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` only).

---

## Phase 1 – Modular Auth Provider Abstraction

**Goal:** Introduce a pluggable auth module with a clear provider contract.

- [x] Create `AuthModule` exposing `AuthGuard`, `RolesGuard`, and `AuthContext` injection token.  
  _Module:_ `backend/src/auth/auth.module.ts` registered globally; guards available for downstream modules.
- [x] Implement `LocalDevProvider` (API key / allow-all) to preserve OSS developer experience.  
  _Provider:_ `backend/src/auth/providers/local-auth.provider.ts` supports bearer API keys, optional org headers, and fallback dev mode.
- [x] Implement `ClerkProvider` that verifies Clerk JWTs, then consults the platform control plane for org/role enrichment via service-account APIs before normalizing claims to `{ userId, organizationId, roles: ['ADMIN'|'MEMBER'] }`.
- [x] Add configuration + boot-time validation to select provider (`AUTH_PROVIDER=local|clerk`).  
  _AuthService:_ selects provider via `auth` config, logging active strategy on boot (Clerk requires only `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`).
- [ ] Provide testing harness & unit tests for guard behaviours.

---

## Phase 2 – Org-Scoped Persistence & Access Guards

**Goal:** Ensure every resource is stored and queried with organization context and enforced roles.

- [ ] Apply schema migrations adding `organization_id` (+ indexes) to workflows, workflow runs, secrets, secret versions, files/artifacts.
- [ ] Backfill existing records using a temporary default org (or flag for manual migration).
- [ ] Update repositories & services to require `AuthContext.organizationId`, filter queries, and reject cross-org access.
- [ ] Introduce `workflow_roles` (workflow/user/role) table limited to `ADMIN`/`MEMBER`.
- [ ] Implement decorators/guards for resource-level permissions (e.g., only admins can mutate workflows).
- [ ] Extend worker run payloads & Trace adapters to persist organization metadata end-to-end.
- [ ] Add regression tests covering org isolation and role enforcement.

---

## Phase 3 – Frontend & Client Auth Plumbing

**Goal:** Propagate auth tokens from the browser to the Studio backend and respect role-based UI states.

- [ ] Update `@shipsec/backend-client` to accept an auth middleware hook and attach bearer tokens.
- [ ] Extend `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to source tokens (Clerk or other) and forward them with each request.
- [ ] Add a lightweight auth store exposing `userId`, `organizationId`, and roles to the UI.
- [ ] Apply role-aware UI gating (disable edits for `MEMBER`, hide destructive actions unless `ADMIN`).
- [ ] Provide fallback UX for local provider (e.g., API key input banner).
- [ ] Add unit/component tests for auth-aware UI.

---

## Phase 4 – Platform Bridge & Service Accounts

**Goal:** Let Studio treat the platform as the authoritative profile/permission service via scoped service-account APIs.

### Platform-side changes

- [ ] Create a dedicated service-account scope for Studio (read user/org/role metadata, list components, register workflow pointers).
- [ ] Expose a typed `/service/studio/context` endpoint returning `{ userId, organizationId, roles, orgMetadata }` for a given user; require Studio service-account auth.
- [ ] Provide `/service/studio/workflows` endpoints for linking platform agents to Studio workflow IDs (create/update/delete).
- [ ] Document token provisioning (how ops issues Studio’s service-account token).

### Studio backend changes

- [x] Extend `ClerkProvider` to validate end-user tokens, then call platform `/service/studio/context` using the configured service-account token to fetch org/role data.
- [ ] Cache context per request, respect platform roles when enforcing workflow + secret permissions. _(Create/update/list workflows now require org context; remaining routes still need enforcement.)_
- [ ] Support platform-triggered runs: accept service-account tokens from platform, verify via existing local provider or dedicated guard, and enforce org assertions.
- [ ] Emit run lifecycle events/webhooks so the platform can mirror execution state (status updates, trace summaries).
- [ ] Continue to store minimal org IDs locally while treating platform data as canonical.
- [ ] Expose a documented `AuthProviderStrategy` interface plus registration hook so downstream users can ship custom providers without patching core code.
- [ ] Make platform enrichment client optional/config driven (`AUTH_PROVIDER=custom`, `AUTH_CUSTOM_MODULE=...`) so integrators can point to their own API without forking.

### Coupling guidance

- Keep interactions behind a narrow, versioned service API so Studio depends only on stable contracts, not database internals.
- Use service accounts + declarative scopes rather than direct DB or JWT claim overloading to avoid tight coupling.
- Document fallbacks so OSS deployments can run with the local provider without a platform dependency.

---

## Phase 5 – Documentation & Rollout

**Goal:** Provide clear guidance for OSS users and internal teams.

- [ ] Update `docs/guide.md` with auth provider configuration steps.
- [ ] Add a new `docs/auth.md` (or similar) outlining token flow, role matrix, and extension hooks.
- [ ] Record integration notes in `.ai/visual-execution-notes.md` or platform docs as needed.
- [ ] Deliver migration/runbook instructions for applying the new schema & config.
- [ ] Capture follow-up tasks (e.g., additional roles, audit logging) in repository backlog.

---

## Phase 6 – Extensibility & Custom Auth Hooks

**Goal:** Ensure community adopters can plug in alternative identity providers with minimal friction.

- [ ] Publish `AuthProviderStrategy` interface and DI token in `@shipsec/backend`.
- [ ] Allow runtime composition via config/env (`AUTH_PROVIDER=custom`, `AUTH_CUSTOM_PROVIDER=modulePath#export`).
- [ ] Provide example custom provider in docs/tests (e.g., GitHub OAuth mock).
- [ ] Validate fallback behaviour when enrichment endpoints are unavailable (graceful degradation to local roles).
- [ ] Document extension points for both frontend (token sourcing) and backend (provider wiring).

---

**Success Criteria**

- Studio enforces org isolation and `ADMIN`/`MEMBER` roles on every sensitive route.
- Production deployments can plug in Clerk/platform identity without code changes.
- Local OSS usage remains simple (toggle-able local provider).
- Platform remains the source of truth for org/user data; Studio consumes it via a stable service interface without duplicating state.
- Third parties can register custom auth providers without forking the codebase, and Studio gracefully handles deployments without platform integration.
