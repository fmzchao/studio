ShipSec Studio uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as its command runner. Run `just` or `just help` to see all available commands.

---

## Getting Started

### Initialize Project

```bash
just init
```

Sets up the development environment:
- Installs dependencies with Bun
- Creates environment files from examples (`backend/.env`, `worker/.env`, `frontend/.env`)

---

## Development Commands

### Start Development Environment

```bash
just dev
```

Starts the full development environment with hot-reload:
- Checks for environment files
- Starts Docker infrastructure (Postgres, Temporal, MinIO, Loki)
- Waits for services to be ready
- Runs database migrations
- Starts backend, worker, and frontend via PM2

**Access points:**
| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173 |
| Backend | http://localhost:3211 |
| Temporal UI | http://localhost:8081 |

### Stop Development

```bash
just dev stop
```

Stops all PM2 processes and Docker infrastructure.

### View Logs

```bash
just dev logs
```

Streams logs from all application processes via PM2.

### Check Status

```bash
just dev status
```

Shows status of PM2 processes and Docker containers.

---

## Production Commands

### Start Production

```bash
just prod
```

Starts the production environment using Docker Compose with pre-built images.

**Access points:**
| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:8090 |
| Backend | http://localhost:3211 |
| Temporal UI | http://localhost:8081 |

### Build and Start

```bash
just prod build
```

Builds Docker images and starts the production environment.

### Stop Production

```bash
just prod stop
```

Stops all production containers.

### View Production Logs

```bash
just prod logs
```

Streams logs from all production containers.

### Check Production Status

```bash
just prod status
```

Shows status of production containers.

### Clean Production

<Danger>This deletes all data.</Danger>

```bash
just prod clean
```

Stops containers, removes volumes, and prunes Docker system.


---

## Infrastructure Commands

### Start Infrastructure

```bash
just infra up
```

Starts only the infrastructure containers:
- PostgreSQL
- Temporal
- MinIO
- Redis
- Loki

### Stop Infrastructure

```bash
just infra down
```

Stops all infrastructure containers.

### View Infrastructure Logs

```bash
just infra logs
```

Streams logs from infrastructure containers.

### Clean Infrastructure

```bash
just infra clean

<Danger>This deletes all data.</Danger>

---

## Utility Commands

### Show All Status

```bash
just status
```

Comprehensive status check showing:
- PM2 services
- Infrastructure containers
- Production containers

### Reset Database

```bash
just db-reset
```

Drops and recreates the database, then runs migrations. **This deletes all data.**

<Warning>
  This command requires PostgreSQL to be running (`just dev` or `just infra up`).
</Warning>

### Build Images Only

```bash
just build
```

Builds production Docker images without starting containers.

## Environment Files

The `just init` command creates these environment files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/.env` | Backend API configuration |
| `worker/.env` | Worker configuration |
| `frontend/.env` | Frontend configuration |

Each file is created from its corresponding `.env.example` template.
