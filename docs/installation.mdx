description: "Self-host ShipSec Studio on your infrastructure"
---

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with ≥8 GB RAM
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- Open ports: `5433`, `7233`, `8081`, `9000`, `9001`, `3100`

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone & initialize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shipsecai/studio.git
cd studio
just init
```

<Note>
  **macOS users:** If you see native module errors, run:
  ```bash
  export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
  bun install
  ```
</Note>

The `just init` command automatically:
- Installs project dependencies with Bun
- Creates environment files from examples (`backend/.env`, `worker/.env`, `frontend/.env`)

### 2. Configure environment variables

Edit the generated `.env` files as needed:

```bash
# Edit environment files
nano backend/.env
nano worker/.env
nano frontend/.env
```

### 3. Start development environment

```bash
just dev
```

The `just dev` command automatically:
- Checks that environment files exist
- Starts Docker infrastructure (Postgres, Temporal, MinIO, Loki)
- Waits for services to be ready
- Runs database migrations
- Starts backend, worker, and frontend with hot-reload

## Production Deployment

For production, use the Docker-based deployment:

```bash
# Start production environment with cached images
just prod

# Or build and start
just prod build
```

Production endpoints:
- Frontend: http://localhost:8090
- Backend: http://localhost:3211
- Temporal UI: http://localhost:8081

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
just dev          # Start development environment
just dev stop     # Stop everything
just dev logs     # View application logs
just dev status   # Check service status
just dev clean    # Stop and remove all data
```

### Production

```bash
just prod          # Start with cached images
just prod build    # Rebuild and start
just prod stop     # Stop production
just prod logs     # View production logs
just prod status   # Check production status
just prod clean    # Remove all data
```

### Infrastructure

```bash
just infra up     # Start infrastructure only
just infra down   # Stop infrastructure
just infra logs   # View infrastructure logs
just infra clean  # Remove infrastructure data
```

### Utilities

```bash
just status       # Show status of all services
just db-reset     # Reset database (drops all data)
just build        # Build images only
```

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: Native module build errors

```bash
export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
bun install
```

### Services not starting

```bash
# Check status
just dev status

# Restart everything
just dev stop
just dev
```

### Database connection failed

```bash
# Run migrations manually
bun run migrate

# Check database logs
just infra logs
```

### PM2 processes failing

```bash
# Check environment files
ls -la */.env

# Restart everything
just dev stop
just dev

# Check logs
just dev logs
```

### Frontend not loading

```bash
# Check if dev server is running
just dev status

# Start manually if needed
bun --cwd frontend dev
```

### Temporal namespace missing

```bash
docker compose -p shipsec --profile setup up -d
```

### Clean rebuild

```bash
just dev stop
just infra clean
just infra up
bun run migrate
just dev
```

## Manual Setup (Optional)

If you need more control over the setup process:

### Infrastructure only

```bash
just infra up
just status
just infra logs
```

### Applications only

```bash
pm2 start pm2.config.cjs
pm2 status
pm2 logs
```
