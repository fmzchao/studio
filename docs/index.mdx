## Why ShipSec Studio?

- **No code required** – Build powerful security workflows by connecting components visually. No scripting, no glue code, no maintenance headaches.
- **Built for security teams** – Pre-built components for subdomain discovery, vulnerability scanning, secret detection, and more. Focus on security, not infrastructure.
- **Workflows that don't fail silently** – Automatic retries, resumable executions, and real-time log streaming, giving visibility into every step. Know exactly what's happening and why.
- **Self-hosted and open source** – Your data stays on your infrastructure. Run it on a laptop or scale to production with the same codebase.
- **Secure by default** – Encrypted secrets, isolated container execution, and team-based access controls built in from day one.
